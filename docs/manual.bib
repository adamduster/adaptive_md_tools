abstract = {Motivated by the long-term goal of theoretically analyzing long-range proton transfer (PT) kinetics in biomolecular pumps, researchers made a number of technical developments in the framework of quantum mechanics-molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations. A set of collective reaction coordinates is proposed for characterizing the progress of long-range proton transfers; unlike previous suggestions, the new coordinates can describe PT along highly nonlinear three-dimensional pathways. Calculations using a realistic model of carbonic anhydrase demonstrated that adiabatic mapping using these collective coordinates gives reliable energetics and critical geometrical parameters as compared to minimum energy path calculations, which suggests that the new coordinates can be effectively used as reaction coordinate in potential of mean force calculations for long-range PT in complex systems. In addition, the generalized solvent boundary potential was implemented in the QM/MM framework for rectangular geometries, which is useful for studying reactions in membrane systems. The resulting protocol was found to produce water structure in the interior of aquaporin consistent with previous studies including a much larger number of explicit solvent and lipid molecules. The effect of electrostatics for PT through a membrane protein was also illustrated with a simple model channel embedded in different dielectric continuum environments. The encouraging results observed so far suggest that robust theoretical analysis of long-range PT kinetics in biomolecular pumps can soon be realized in a QM/MM framework. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {By reclassifying atoms as QM or MM on-the-fly, adaptive QM/MM dynamics simulations can utilize small QM subsystems whose locations and contents are continuously and automatically updated. Although adaptive QM/MM has been applied in studies of a variety of ions, dynamics simulations of a hydrated proton in bulk water remain a challenge. The difficulty arises from the need to transfer structural features (the covalent and hydrogen bonding networks) via the Grotthuss mechanism instead of the given proton. One must therefore identify an appropriate reference point from which the QM subsystem can be positioned that continuously follows the structural variations as the proton hops. To solve this problem, we propose a proton indicator that serves as the needed reference point. The location of the proton indicator varies smoothly from the hydronium oxygen in the resting (Eigen) state to the shared proton in the transition (Zundel) state. The algorithm is implemented in the framework of a modified permuted adaptive-partitioning QM/MM. As a proof of concept, we simulate an excess proton solvated in bulk water, where the QM subsystem is defined as a sphere of 4.0 {\AA} radius centered at the proton indicator. We find that the use of the proton indicator prevents abrupt changes in the location and contents of the QM subsystem. The new method yields reasonably good agreement in the proton solvation structure and in the proton transfer dynamics with previously reported conventional QM/MM dynamics simulations that employed a much larger QM subsystem (a sphere of 12 {\AA} radius). Also, the results do not change significantly with respect to variations in the time step size (0.1 or 0.5 fs), truncation of the many-body expansion of the potential (from fifth to second order), and absence/presence of thermostat. The proton indicator combined with the modified permuted adaptive-partitioning scheme thus appears to be a useful tool for studying proton transfer in solution.},

@article{Chakrabarti2004,
abstract = {Aquaporins are an important class of membrane channels selective for water and linear polyols but impermeable to ions, including protons. Recent computational studies have revealed that the relay of protons through the water-conduction pathway of aquaporin channels is opposed by a substantial free energy barrier peaking at the signature NPA motifs. Here, free-energy simulations and continuum electrostatic calculations are combined to examine the nature and the magnitude of the contribution of specific structural elements to proton blockage in the bacterial glycerol uptake facilitator, GlpF. Potential of mean-force profiles for both hop and turn steps of structural diffusion in the narrow pore are obtained for artificial variants of the GlpF channel in which coulombic interactions between the pore contents and conserved residues Asn68 and Asn203 at the NPA signature motifs, Arg206 at the selectivity filter, and the peptidic backbone of the two half-helices M3 and M7, which are arranged in head-to-head fashion around the NPA motifs, are turned off selectively. A comparison of these results with electrostatic energy profiles for the translocation of a probe cation throughout the water permeation pathway indicates that the free-energy profile for proton movement inside the narrow pore is dominated by static effects arising from the distribution of charged and polar groups of the channel, whereas dielectric effects contribute primarily to opposing the access of H+to the pore mouths (desolvation penalty). The single most effective way to abolish the free-energy gradients opposing the movement of H+around the NPA motif is to turn off the dipole moments of helices M3 and M7. Mutation of either of the two NPA Asn residues to Asp compensates for charge-dipole and dipole-dipole effects opposing the hop and turn steps of structural diffusion, respectively, and dramatically reduces the free energy barrier of proton translocation, suggesting that these single mutants could leak protons. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
